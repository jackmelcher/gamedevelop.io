                    <h3>Recruiting Team Members</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you plan on making your game with a team, you're gonna have to make a layout of the team's size and various roles.
                        Determine what tasks each role will be responsible for, and how many individuals you will need for each role.
                        Once you've decide on what role you want to play, you can fill the remaining roles by recruiting additional members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Draft a recruitment post for your project and the open roles.
                        Describe the game's premise, the game's genre, the available roles, each role's responsiblilities, skill and experience requirements, the estimated production time, and minimum time commitment per week.
                        Also, make it clear if you are offerring any form of compensation (Unpaid, revenue-share, hourly payment, or commission based payment).
                        The more detail you provide, the more likely people will inquire and join your team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best way to recruit team members is by publishing your recruitment post on subreddits, forums, and discord servers.
                        You can also contact individuals directly who post that they are open to joining a team.
                        If there are any local game dev meetups, you can attend and ask attendees if they would be interested in joining your project.
                        In the event you have trouble recruiting people, then consider contracting freelancers instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you make people sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before divulging any details about your game, then people may be less likely to contact you about your project.
                        While an NDA is a good way to keep your business and game idea a secret, the lack of information about the project may inhibit your ability to recruit the right individuals to your team.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="factors">
                    <h3>Factors to Consider While Recruiting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Factors to consider while recruiting members are: experience and compensation, availabile time commitment, physical location, and time zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Less experienced individuals will be willing to work for free, but may lead to slower production.
                        More experienced individuals will expect payment for their high skill labor, especially if your project requires a significant time commitment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a person is only available a few hours out of the week, then progress on the project will be very slow and not be suitable to meet your intended release deadline.
                        Most people are available part-time to work on projects, so progress will be steady.
                        Someone working on the project full-time means daily progress can be made and weekly production schedules will be more necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working with people locally allows you to meet up in person, which makes it easier for people to motivate each other and hold each other accountable.
                        Working with people in the same time zone also makes it easier to synchronize the production schedule and ensure everyone is working around the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working remotely will require more leadership and management to make sure team members are on task, as it takes more time to build trust and maintain moral.
                        While working with people in different time zones is possible, even with those on different continents, there may be substantial delays in communication and it will take a lot more effort to manage.
                        But if you can manage to create a global team, it allows people to work on the project anytime, anywhere, around the clock.
                    </p>

                <div id="experience">
                    <h3>How Team Size and Experience Affects Production</h3>
                    <p>
                        The team’s skill level will determine whether implementing certain features is feasible and if it can be done in a timely manner.
                        The team's size will determine how much of the work can be distributed and completed in parallel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A team comprised of inexperienced members may result in poor implementation of complex features.
                        Development will take longer as team members spend time gathering the new information and learning new skills.
                        Experienced members likely already know how to build the required systems and have an easier time expanding upon them.
                        Production time will also be more predictable and move at a steadier pace with a more experienced team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are a solo dev, then production time is entirely decided by you.
                        Every aspect of the game will require your attention.
                        You will be knowledgeable in multiple areas, but the trade off is that you will not be specialized into one discipline.
                        As a result, production times will drastically increase because all tasks will have to be performed sequentially.
                        But, you have full creative control of your game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a team of specialized individuals, tasks can be divided up and completed in parallel.
                        Multiple tasks can be finished during each iteration cycle, allowing the team to build prototypes of the game faster.
                        Smaller teams will still require members to complete tasks in several departments, but still allow development to move faster than a solo developer.
                        The final product will be a culmination of the all creative efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the team size increases, management of the project gets more difficult.
                        You will have to spend more time organizing task work and making sure team members have something to work on.
                        Managing efforts also helps prevents team members working on the same task by accident.
